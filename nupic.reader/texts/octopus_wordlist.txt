The
octopus
or
plural
octopuses
octopi
or
octopodes
see
below
is
a
cephalopod
mollusc
of
the
order
Octopoda
Octopuses
have
two
eyes
and
four
pairs
of
arms
and
like
other
cephalopods
they
are
bilaterally
symmetric
An
octopus
has
a
hard
beak
with
its
mouth
at
the
center
point
of
the
arms
Octopuses
have
no
internal
or
external
skeleton
although
some
species
have
a
vestigial
remnant
of
a
shell
inside
their
mantles
allowing
them
to
squeeze
through
tight
places
Octopuses
are
among
the
most
intelligent
and
behaviorally
flexible
of
all
invertebrates
The
octopus
inhabits
many
diverse
regions
of
the
ocean
including
coral
reefs
pelagic
waters
and
the
ocean
floor
They
have
numerous
strategies
for
defending
themselves
against
predators
including
the
expulsion
of
ink
the
use
of
camouflage
and
deimatic
displays
their
ability
to
jet
quickly
through
the
water
and
their
ability
to
hide
An
octopus
trails
its
eight
arms
behind
it
as
it
swims
All
octopuses
are
venomous
but
only
one
group
the
octopus
is
known
to
be
deadly
to
humans
Around
300
species
are
recognized
which
is
over
of
the
total
number
of
known
cephalopod
species
The
term
octopus
may
also
be
used
to
refer
only
to
those
creatures
in
the
genus
Octopus
BiologyOctopuses
are
characterized
by
their
eight
arms
usually
bearing
suction
cups
The
arms
of
octopuses
are
often
distinguished
from
the
pair
of
feeding
tentacles
found
in
squid
and
cuttlefish
Unlike
most
other
cephalopods
the
majority
of
octopuses
those
in
the
suborder
most
commonly
known
Incirrina
have
almost
entirely
soft
bodies
with
no
internal
skeleton
They
have
neither
a
protective
outer
shell
like
the
nautilus
nor
any
vestige
of
an
internal
shell
or
bones
like
cuttlefish
or
squid
The
beak
similar
in
shape
to
a
parrot
beak
and
made
of
chitin
is
the
only
hard
part
of
their
bodies
This
enables
them
to
squeeze
through
very
narrow
slits
between
underwater
rocks
which
is
very
helpful
when
they
are
fleeing
from
moray
eels
or
other
predatory
fish
The
octopuses
in
the
Cirrina
suborder
have
two
fins
and
an
internal
shell
generally
reducing
their
ability
to
squeeze
into
small
spaces
These
cirrate
species
are
often
and
live
in
habitats
while
incirrate
octopus
species
are
found
in
reefs
and
other
shallower
seafloor
habitats
Octopuses
have
a
relatively
short
life
expectancy
and
some
species
live
for
as
little
as
six
months
Larger
species
such
as
the
giant
pacific
octopus
may
live
for
up
to
five
years
under
suitable
circumstances
However
reproduction
is
a
cause
of
death
males
can
only
live
for
a
few
months
after
mating
and
females
die
shortly
after
their
eggs
hatch
They
neglect
to
eat
during
the
roughly
period
spent
taking
care
of
their
unhatched
eggs
eventually
dying
of
starvation
In
a
scientific
experiment
removal
of
both
optic
glands
after
spawning
was
found
to
result
in
cessation
of
broodiness
resumption
of
feeding
increased
growth
and
greatly
extended
lifespans
Octopuses
have
three
hearts
Two
branchial
hearts
pump
blood
through
each
of
the
two
gills
while
the
third
is
a
systemic
heart
that
pumps
blood
through
the
body
Octopus
blood
contains
the
protein
hemocyanin
for
transporting
oxygen
Although
less
efficient
under
normal
conditions
than
the
hemoglobin
of
vertebrates
in
cold
conditions
with
low
oxygen
pressure
hemocyanin
oxygen
transportation
is
more
efficient
than
hemoglobin
oxygen
transportation
The
hemocyanin
is
dissolved
in
the
plasma
instead
of
being
carried
within
red
blood
cells
and
gives
the
blood
a
bluish
color
The
octopus
draws
water
into
its
mantle
cavity
where
it
passes
through
its
gills
As
mollusks
their
gills
are
finely
divided
and
vascularized
outgrowths
of
either
the
outer
or
the
inner
body
surface
Octopuses
are
highly
intelligent
possibly
more
so
than
any
other
order
of
invertebrates
The
exact
extent
of
their
intelligence
and
learning
capability
is
much
debated
among
biologists

but
maze
and
experiments
have
shown
evidence
of
a
memory
system
that
can
store
both
short
and
memory
It
is
not
known
precisely
what
contribution
learning
makes
to
adult
octopus
behavior
Young
octopuses
learn
almost
no
behaviors
from
their
parents
with
whom
they
have
very
little
contact
An
octopus
has
a
highly
complex
nervous
system
only
part
of
which
is
localized
in
its
brain
of
an
octopus
neurons
are
found
in
the
nerve
cords
of
its
arms
which
have
limited
functional
autonomy
Octopus
arms
show
a
variety
of
complex
reflex
actions
that
persist
even
when
they
have
no
input
from
the
brain
In
laboratory
experiments
octopuses
can
be
readily
trained
to
distinguish
between
different
shapes
and
patterns
They
have
been
reported
to
practice
observational
learning
13
although
the
validity
of
these
findings
is
widely
contested
on
a
number
of
grounds
They
have
even
boarded
fishing
boats
and
opened
holds
to
eat
crabs
In
some
countries
octopuses
are
on
the
list
of
experimental
animals
on
which
surgery
may
not
be
performed
without
anesthesia
In
the
UK
until
2013
the
common
octopus
Octopus
vulgaris
was
the
only
invertebrate
protected
under
the
Animals
Scientific
Procedures
Act
1986
extending
to
them
protections
not
normally
afforded
to
invertebrates
Tool
useThe
octopus
has
been
shown
to
use
tools
At
least
four
specimens
of
the
veined
octopus
Amphioctopus
marginatus
have
been
witnessed
retrieving
discarded
coconut
shells
manipulating
them
and
then
reassembling
them
to
use
as
shelter
This
discovery
was
documented
in
the
journal
Current
Biology
and
has
also
been
filmed
DefenseAn
octopus
main
primary
defense
is
to
hide
either
not
to
be
seen
at
all
or
through
camouflage
and
mimicry
not
to
be
detected
as
an
octopus
The
most
common
secondary
defense
is
fast
escape
Other
defenses
include
distraction
with
the
use
of
ink
sacs
and
autotomising
limbs
Most
octopuses
can
eject
a
thick
blackish
ink
in
a
large
cloud
to
aid
in
escaping
from
predators
The
main
coloring
agent
of
the
ink
is
melanin
which
is
the
same
chemical
that
gives
humans
their
hair
and
skin
color
This
ink
cloud
is
thought
to
reduce
the
efficiency
of
olfactory
organs
which
would
aid
an
octopus
evasion
from
predators
that
employ
smell
for
hunting
such
as
sharks
Ink
clouds
of
some
species
might
serve
as
pseudomorphs
or
decoys
that
the
predator
attacks
instead
An
octopus
camouflage
is
aided
by
certain
specialized
skin
cells
which
can
change
the
apparent
color
opacity
and
reflectivity
of
the
epidermis
Chromatophores
contain
yellow
orange
red
brown
or
black
pigments
most
species
have
three
of
these
colors
while
some
have
two
or
four
Other
cells
are
reflective
iridophores
and
leucophores
white
The
very
venomous
octopus
becomes
bright
yellow
with
blue
rings
when
it
is
provoked
Octopuses
can
use
muscles
in
the
skin
to
change
the
texture
of
their
mantle
to
achieve
a
greater
camouflage
In
some
species
the
mantle
can
take
on
the
spiky
appearance
of
seaweed
or
the
scraggly
bumpy
texture
of
a
rock
among
other
disguises
However
in
some
species
skin
anatomy
is
limited
to
relatively
patternless
shades
of
one
color
and
limited
skin
texture
It
is
thought
that
octopuses
that
are
live
in
complex
habitats
such
as
coral
reefs
have
evolved
more
complex
skin
than
their
nocturnal
relatives
When
under
attack
some
octopuses
can
perform
arm
autotomy
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
way
skinks
and
other
lizards
detach
their
tails
The
crawling
arm
serves
as
a
distraction
to
predators
Such
severed
arms
remain
sensitive
to
stimuli
and
move
away
from
unpleasant
sensations
A
few
species
such
as
the
mimic
octopus
have
a
fourth
defense
mechanism
They
can
combine
their
highly
flexible
bodies
with
their
ability
to
accurately
mimic
other
more
dangerous
animals
such
as
lionfish
sea
snakes
and
eels
ReproductionWhen
octopuses
reproduce
the
male
uses
a
specialized
arm
called
a
hectocotylus
to
transfer
spermatophores
packets
of
sperm
from
the
terminal
organ
of
the
reproductive
tract
the
cephalopod
penis
into
the
female
mantle
cavity
Males
die
within
a
few
months
of
mating
In
some
species
the
female
octopus
can
keep
the
sperm
alive
inside
her
for
weeks
until
her
eggs
are
mature
After
they
have
been
fertilized
the
female
lays
about
eggs
this
figure
dramatically
varies
between
families
genera
species
and
also
individuals
SensesOctopuses
have
keen
eyesight
Like
other
cephalopods
they
can
distinguish
the
polarization
of
light
Color
vision
appears
to
vary
from
species
to
species
being
present
in
aegina
but
absent
in
vulgaris
An
autonomic
response
keeps
the
octopus
eyes
oriented
so
the
pupil
slit
is
always
horizontal
Octopuses
also
have
an
excellent
sense
of
touch
An
octopus
suction
cups
are
equipped
with
chemoreceptors
so
the
octopus
can
taste
what
it
is
touching
The
arms
contain
tension
sensors
so
the
octopus
knows
whether
its
arms
are
stretched
out
However
it
has
a
very
poor
proprioceptive
sense
The
tension
receptors
are
not
sufficient
for
the
brain
to
determine
the
position
of
the
octopus
body
or
arms
As
a
result
the
octopus
does
not
possess
stereognosis
that
is
it
does
not
form
a
mental
image
of
the
overall
shape
of
the
object
it
is
handling
It
can
detect
local
texture
variations
but
cannot
integrate
the
information
into
a
larger
picture
The
neurological
autonomy
of
the
arms
means
the
octopus
has
great
difficulty
learning
about
the
detailed
effects
of
its
motions
The
brain
may
issue
a
command
to
the
arms
but
the
nerve
cords
in
the
arms
execute
the
details
There
is
no
neurological
path
for
the
brain
to
receive
proprioceptive
feedback
about
just
how
its
command
was
executed
by
the
arms
the
only
way
it
knows
just
what
motions
were
made
is
by
observing
the
arms
visually
exteroception
Octopuses
might
use
the
statocyst
a
structure
containing
a
mineralised
mass
and
sensitive
hairs
to
register
sound
LocomotionOctopuses
move
about
by
crawling
or
swimming
Their
main
means
of
slow
travel
is
crawling
with
some
swimming
Jet
propulsion
is
their
fastest
means
of
locomotion
followed
by
swimming
and
walking
They
crawl
by
walking
on
their
arms
usually
on
many
at
once
on
both
solid
and
soft
surfaces
while
supported
in
water
In
2005
some
octopuses
Adopus
aculeatus
and
Amphioctopus
marginatus
under
current
taxonomy
were
found
to
walk
on
two
arms
while
at
the
same
time
resembling
plant
matter
Octopuses
swim
by
expelling
a
jet
of
water
from
a
contractile
mantle
and
aiming
it
via
a
muscular
siphon
octopuses
eat
mainly
crabs
polychaete
worms
and
other
molluscs
such
as
whelks
and
clams
octopuses
eat
mainly
prawns
fish
and
other
cephalopods
They
usually
inject
their
prey
with
a
paralysing
saliva
before
dismembering
it
into
small
pieces
with
their
beaks
Large
octopuses
have
also
been
known
to
catch
and
kill
some
species
of
sharks
The
giant
Pacific
octopus
Enteroctopus
dofleini
is
often
cited
as
the
largest
octopus
species
Adults
usually
weigh
around
15
kg
33
lb
with
an
arm
span
of
up
to
m
14
ft
Etymology
and
pluralizationThe
term
octopus
is
derived
42
43
44
through
scientific
Latin
from
ancient
Greek
eight
and
foot
The
usual
plural
in
English
is
octopuses
pronounced
but
the
Greek
plural
form
octopodes
pronounced
is
sometimes
used
though
less
frequently
than
in
the
past
The
Oxford
English
Dictionary
2008
Draft
Revision
52
also
lists
octopuses
octopi
and
octopodes
in
that
order
labelling
octopodes
as
rare
and
noting
that
octopi
derives
from
the
misapprehension
that
octpus
is
a
Latin
noun
and
stating
that
if
the
word
were
native
to
Latin
it
would
be
third
declension
octps
plural
octpedes
after
the
pattern
of
ps
foot
plural
peds

Relationship
to
humansAncient
peoples
of
the
Mediterranean
were
aware
of
the
octopus
as
evidenced
by
certain
artworks
and
designs
of
prehistory
For
example

stone
carving
found
in
the
archaeological
recovery
from
Bronze
Age
Minoan
Crete
at
Knossos

1100
BC
has
a
depiction
of
a
fisherman
carrying
an
octopus
The
octopus
Octopuses
were
often
depicted
in
the
art
of
the
Moche
people
of
ancient
Peru
who
worshipped
the
sea
and
its
animals
In
mythologyThe
Gorgon
of
Greek
mythology
has
been
thought
to
have
been
inspired
by
the
octopus
or
squid
the
octopus
itself
representing
the
severed
head
of
Medusa
the
beak
as
the
protruding
tongue
and
fangs
and
its
tentacles
as

proportions
said
to
dwell
off
the
coasts
of

relates
that
the

is
only
the
last
of
a

account
the
octopus
is
the
lone

in
Hokkaid
and
has
been
sighted
in
several
locations
including
Taiwan
and
Korea
since
the
19th

octopus
has
a
significant
role
in
Victor

Sea
As
a
metaphorDue
to
having
numerous
arms
that
emanate
from
a
common
center
the
octopus
is
often
used
as
a
metaphor
for
a
group
or
organization
which
is
perceived
as
being
powerful
manipulative
or
bent
on
domination
Use
of
this
terminology
is
invariably
negative
and
employed
by
the
opponents
of
the
groups
or
institutions
so
described
As
foodHumans
eat
octopus
in
many
cultures
The
arms
and
sometimes
other
body
parts
are
prepared
in
various
ways
often
varying
by
species
Octopus
is
a
common
ingredient
in
Japanese
cuisine
including
sushi
takoyaki
and
akashiyaki
In
Korea
some
small
species
are
sometimes
eaten
alive
as
a
novelty
food
A
live
octopus
is
usually
sliced
up
and
it
is
eaten
while
still
squirming
Octopus
is
eaten
regularly
in
Hawaii
since
many
popular
dishes
are
Asian
in
origin
Locally
known
by
their
Hawaiian
or
Japanese
names
and
tako
respectively
octopus
is
also
a
popular
fish

Octopus
is
a
common

in
Mediterranean
cuisine
and
Portuguese

octopus
is
a
local

Restaurants
which
specialize
or

this
dish
are
known
as

On
the
Tunisian
island
of
Djerba
local
people
catch
octopuses
by
taking
advantage
of
the
animals
habit
of
hiding
in
safe
places
during
the
night
In
the
evening
they
put
grey
ceramic
pots
on
the
sea
bed
The
morning
of
the
following
day
they
check
them
for
octopuses
sheltered
there
A
common
scene
in
the
Greek
islands
is
octopuses
hanging
in
the
sunlight
from
a
rope
just
like
laundry
from
a
clothesline
They
are
often
caught
by
spear
fishing
close
to
the
shore
The
fisherman
brings
his
prey
to
land
and
tenderizes
the
flesh
by
pounding
the
carcass
against
a
stone
surface
Thus
treated
they
are
hung
out
to
dry
and
later
will
be
served
grilled
either
hot
or
chilled
in
a
salad
They
are
considered
a
superb
meze
especially
alongside
ouzo
According
to
the
USDA
Nutrient
Database
2007
cooked
octopus
contains
about
139
kilocalories
Calories
per
portion
and
is
a
source
of
vitamin
B3
B12
potassium
phosphorus
and
selenium
Care
must
be
taken
to
boil
the
octopus
properly
to
rid
it
of
slime
smell
and
residual
ink
As
petsThough
octopuses
can
be
difficult
to
keep
in
captivity
some
people
keep
them
as
pets
They
often
escape
even
from
supposedly
secure
tanks
due
to
their
skills
mobility
and
lack
of
rigid
structure
The
variation
in
size
and
lifespan
among
octopus
species
makes
it
difficult
to
know
how
long
a
new
specimen
can
naturally
be
expected
to
live
That
is
a
small
octopus
may
be
just
born
or
may
be
an
adult
depending
on
its
species
By
selecting
a
species
such
as
the
California
octopus
one
can
choose
a
small
octopus
around
the
size
of
a
tennis
ball
and
be
confident
it
is
young
with
a
full
life
ahead
of
it

some
confusion
around
the
terms
arms

are
called
tentacles

ring
of
eight
limbs
around
the
mouth
in
cuttlefish
squids
and
octopuses
are
called
arms

and
squid
also
have
a
pair
of
specialized

are
known
as
