# Sine Wave Prediction

* * *

> This is a work-in-progress. 

* * *

This experiment will generate sine wave data into a csv file, then run a swarm against it. The model params generated by the swarm will be used to run NuPIC to predict the sine wave. Output by default will be plotted to `matplotlib`.

Checkout this useful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuFfm3ncEwI) to be talked through running the experiment.

## Plotting output in matplotlib

If you have `matplotlib` installed, you can enable plotting. Otherwise, output is written to a file.

In `sine_experiment.py`, change:

    PLOT = False

to:

    PLOT = True

## To Run:

    python sine_experiment.py
