Starts a NuPIC model from the model params returned by the swarm
and pushes each line of input from the gym into the model. Results
are written to an output file (default) or plotted dynamically if
the --plot option is specified.
NOTE: You must run ./swarm.py before this, because model parameters
are required to run NuPIC.
